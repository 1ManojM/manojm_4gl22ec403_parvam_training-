    <h1>About Us Page</h1>
    <p>This is a about us page rendering in Django.
        Development of Django is supported by an independent foundation established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Like most open-source foundations, 
        the goal of the Django Software Foundation is to promote, support,
         and advance its open-source project: in our case, the Django Web framework.
